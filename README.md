# AMDRobot
Autonomous Metal Detector Robot (Spring 2021 - Fall 2021 senior capstone project) at Tennessee Technological University.  
This group consists of an EE and ME team.

About:
This repository will hold all of the code to be run on the Raspberry Pi 4 B+.  All code will be saved here with local 
copies saved often for redundancy.  If anyone has any questions, direct them to Z Hall (EE).  This repo is open to edits 
from both ME and EE teams.  

How to use:
Edit on your computer, push to Github, and pull on the Pi.  Push updates often to prevent others from overwriting your 
code or from creating overlapping changes.  (There is a feature to make this not so bad, but it's difficult to revert
these changes if it happens.)

**Please comment your changes well in the update and description blank.  Failure to do so will cause headaches.  It will 
take more time to troubleshoot poorly commented code than to write efficient comments.**
